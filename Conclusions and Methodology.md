# Methodology

## Preprocessing
- Imputation of missing values using the median.
- Feature scaling between 0 and 1.

## Exploratory Analysis
- Visualization of distributions and correlations between variables.

## Modeling
- Training a logistic regression model.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

# Conclusions
- The variables with the highest correlation to the target class (diabetes) are:
  - Glucose concentration.
  - Body Mass Index (BMI).
  - Age.
- The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of **75.20%**.
